# DISCLAIMER

If you are using [this famous repack](https://i.imgur.com/Mp6n7la.png) and you don't know where the path to the saves is, follow the steps below. Also, I would recommend you to stop using this repack. Uninstall and delete all files related to it (incluiding residual files) except your saves, keys and firmware. To do this, you can use Revo Unistaller for instance.

The reason is that **this repack is giving many problems in The Legend Of Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom** (you cannot update the game, if you update Ryujinx and the emulator crashes while updating, Ryujinx never opens again, so you'll have to install it separately and the game generates a new game from 0 ... among others problems). So please, have your emulator, rom, keys and firmware backup apart and avoid using this repack. Also, it's a outdated stuff.

# Where are my saved games dude?

If you're wondering where your saves are, take a look at the [following screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/wDHCSzb.png).

You will need to locate that folder, where the repack launcher is located. If you are using Ryujinx, your saves will be in the data or emu folder (I can't remember, open both folders). Inside the folder there should be **another folder** called **bis**. From there, follow the steps to make a backup of [Ryujinx](https://github.com/StevensND/emuswitch-backup/blob/main/Python%20Guide/Python%20Ryujinx.md#steps). Remember that you don't need the Python script (.py file). You can use the .exe instead. Just pay attention to paths.

For Yuzu, it will be the user folder. Then locate the nand folder, again user, save and open the folder with 0's. Your saves should located there.

Finally, backup your saves and import them to your new Yuzu/Ryujinx installation folder.
