# What is required?
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [7-Zip](https://7-zip.org/download.html) or WinRAR to extract the .zip file.
- [Script](https://github.com/StevensND/emuswitch-backup/releases)

## Steps

- If you use the **`user` folder method** used in step 2 of this [guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewYuzuPiracy/comments/13gh9ts/yuzu_totk_complete_setup_guide_60_fps_cutscenes/), you will have to place the `scripts` folder inside this folder. Your `user` folder should [look like this](https://i.gyazo.com/d3a4c687dc4d479be384b5062263c905.png). **PLEASE:** Make sure the `scripts` folder is inside or the script will not work. 

An example of the correct path would be: `D:\yuzu-windows-msvc-early-access\user`.  You have to place the `scripts` folder inside this path. **Note that this route doesn't have to be yours.**

- If you use the **`Appdata/Roaming/yuzu` folder method**, you will have to place the `scripts` folder inside this folder.

An example of the correct path would be: `C:\Users\Stevens\AppData\Roaming\yuzu`.  You have to place the `scripts` folder inside this path. 

Then just open the `scripts` folder and run `Saves Backup Yuzu.py`

## How do I know which method I am using?

On your keyboard, press the `Windows + R` keys (you don't have to press the `+`) and type `%appdata%`. 

You will see this path: `AppData/Roaming`. If in this path there is a folder named `yuzu`, then you are using this method. Otherwise, you are using the other one.
