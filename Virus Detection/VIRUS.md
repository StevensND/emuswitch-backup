# Disclaimer

For some strange reason that I don't know yet (I don't know if it's because of the way the .exe is generated), Virustotal detects the script as a virus (for this reason I put several links). In some occasions it detects 1 to 4 detections if the file is an .exe. On the other hand, if I make a .zip file from the .exe file this doesn't happen, so I would say that Virustotal has a strange and weird behavior + it's a false positive case.

I have added other pages as well so you can make comparisons. 

If you still don't trust me and think that the files are virus, you can use the versions that need Python and run the .py files. 

You can locate them [here](https://github.com/StevensND/emuswitch-backup/releases) (v2 is the most recent and should work similar as the .exe file, if it doesn't work properly for you, use v1 version). 

Also you could check .exe files code for the script [here](https://github.com/StevensND/emuswitch-backup/tree/main/EXE%20Folder)
