# Disclaimer

For some strange reason that I don't know (I don't know if it's because of the way the .exe is generated), Virustotal detects the script as a virus (for this reason I put several links). In some occasions it detects 1 or 3 if the file is an .exe. On the other hand, if I make a .zip file from the .exe file this doesn't happen, so I would say that Virustotal has a strange and weird behavior.

I have added other pages as well so you can make comparisons. 

If you still don't trust me and the script, you can use the versions that need Python and run the .py files. 

You can locate them [here](https://github.com/StevensND/emuswitch-backup/releases) (v2 is the most recent and would work as the .exe file, if it doesn't work well for you, use v1). 

Also you can check .exe code for the script [here](https://github.com/StevensND/emuswitch-backup/tree/main/EXE%20Folder)
